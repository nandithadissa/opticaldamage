These matlab functions build a simple GUI to control filter wheels. Each bench has a set of filter wheels that work together.

Customize the code for your application by changing (1) the serial port in intiatebench and (2) the wavelengths and neutral density positions in initiate bench.
  
Open the GUI by typing 'GUI' into matlab's command window.
